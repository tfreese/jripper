CD-DISCID
=========
cd-discid is a backend utility to get CDDB discid information from a CD-ROM
disc. It was originally designed for cdgrab (now abcde), but can be used for
any purpose requiring CDDB data.

Using cd-discid is very simple. It accepts one command line parameter, the
device name of the CD-ROM drive to look up. For example:

$ cd-discid /dev/cdrom
7c0b8b0b 11 150 23115 42165 60015 79512 101560 118757 136605 159492 176067 198875 2957

The information returned is, in order:

* 32-bit hex CDDB disc-id. The first byte of this is the track checksum, the
  next two are the length of the CD in seconds, and the last is the number
  of tracks
* Number of tracks
* Frame offset of each track
* Second offset for the leadout track (length of the CD in seconds)

The (lack of) inspiration behind this output format was the CDDB database
server. It accepts requests like so:

42165+60015+79512+101560+118757+136605+159492+176067+198875+2957&hello=user+
hostname+program+version&proto=3

cd-discid was developed with attention to the CDDB specifications, available
at http://www.freedb.org/sections.php?name=Sections?sop=viewarticle&artid=28,
using portions of their sample code.

TODO: output ID3v2 MCDI (Music CD Identifier) frames. Since these are binary in
nature it is unclear what the best method of outputting these should be. If
someone knows of software that can read conforming MCDI frames, please let
me know.
